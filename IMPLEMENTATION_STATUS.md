## 📝 Notes for User

The application is now functional for the core workflow:
1. ✅ Users can register and login
2. ✅ Users can create decks
3. ✅ Users can upload documents and generate flashcards with AI
4. ✅ Users can view their decks and flashcards
5. ✅ AI explanations are available via API (UI pending)

To run the application:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create database tables
4. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

The app is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to continue development and add the remaining features.
